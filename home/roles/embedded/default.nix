`home/roles/embedded/default.nix`
User environment for embedded systems and hardware development

This role provides tools and configurations specifically useful for:
- Raspberry Pi and single-board computer development
- IoT device programming and debugging
- Hardware interfacing (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART)
- Embedded systems monitoring and troubleshooting
- Cross-platform development for ARM/embedded targets

Designed to complement the base and TUI profiles while adding
hardware-specific development capabilities. Can be used with
any system that has hardware development requirements.

Key focus areas:
- Hardware communication tools (serial, I2C, SPI)
- System monitoring for resource-constrained devices
- Network debugging tools for embedded networking
- Development utilities for hardware projects
- Performance monitoring tools suitable for embedded systems
